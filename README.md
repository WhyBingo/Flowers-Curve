## Introduction
 
Flowers curve ([Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph)) is a type of toy invented by Denys Fisher, a British Engineer, and later independently invented by Binglie Yang, a Chinese inventor. In practice, these curves are drawn by moving a small gear inside a ring gear

Based on similar mechanics, I designed this webpage for drawing flowers curve in browser. 
The first GIF is produced with all circles and skeletons shown.
