<h2>Instructions and Terms explained</h2>

Note: Number of circulations required to complete a closed circe = (the least common multiple of the outer circle radius and inner circle radius) / outer circle radius<br/>
Generally, the greater their common factor, the less complicated the graph will be.<br/>

<h3>Drawing step</h3>
This is radius increment of the inner circle. Generally, there's no need to adjust this parameter, unless the line drawn becomes dotted (left picture)<br/>

You may want to decrease this value to eliminate dotted lines or to enhance quality, but the cost is the drawing time.<br/>
You can reduce the drawing time by decreasing the value of the drawing delay.
